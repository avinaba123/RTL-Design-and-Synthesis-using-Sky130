# RTL-Design-and-Synthesis-using-Sky130

That's the documentation for the five-day workshop on "RTL DESIGN USING VERILOG USING SKY130 TECHNOLOGY". Incorporating tools like iverilog, yosys, and gtkwave, this repository contains the design and synthesis of RTL codes.

## GLIMPS OF THE WORKSHOP

This Workshop is as a training program that covers everything from the fundamentals to advanced topics. It was a five-day cloud-based workshop that covered topics like Verilog RTL design and synthesis, Timing Libraries, Hierarchical vs Flat synthesis, Efficient flop coding styles, followed by Combinational and Sequential optimizations, GLS, blocking vs non-blocking, and Synthesis-Simulation mismatch, and optimization in synthesis. The workshop requires a basic understanding of the Verilog HDL, so if you're unfamiliar with Verilog, this might not be the ideal place to start.  In this workshop I was offered the chance to work in an opensource environment. Yosys and Sky130 PDKs were used for the assessments.
